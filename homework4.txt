2. Why do Github users need an SSH key pair? (Users can use either SSH key pair or github account info.) Please write down a brief explanation of SSH key.
ANSWER:
	SSH keys work in pairs: public and private key. Public key is - as the name implies - public, meaning it's shared.
	Private key on the other hand is stored on your device (computer). A user needs an SSH key pair, because the user
	can be granted access only if the keys match.
