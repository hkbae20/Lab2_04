1. What is .gitignore? You can write the answer either in Korean or English.
.gitignore specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore. gitignore files have lines that each
specifies a pattern that Git can read. The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain
files remain untracked by Git.
2. Why do Github users need an SSH key pair? (Users can use either SSH key pair or github account info.) Please write down a brief explanation of SSH key.
An SSH key is an access credential in the SSH protocol. Its function is similar to that of 
user names and passwords, but the keys are primarily used for automated processes 
and for implementing single sign-on by system administrators and power users.

Thus SSH key pair is needed to identify the user.
