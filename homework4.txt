1. What is .gitignore? You can write the answer either in Korean or English.
Answer)
A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
Specifically, backup files, log files, or compiled files that you no longer want in your project.
Files already tracked by Git are not affected by this.
Each line in a gitignore file specifies a pattern.

2. Why do Github users need an SSH key pair? (Users can use either SSH key pair or github account info.) Please write down a brief explanation of SSH key.
Ans)
When working with GitHub, you'll often need to identify yourself to GitHub using your username and password. An SSH key is an alternate way to identify yourself without entering your username and password every time.
SSH keys come in pairs, a public key that gets shared with services like GitHub, and a private key that is stored only on your computer. If the keys match, you're granted access.
The cryptography behind SSH keys ensures that no one can reverse-engineer your private key from the public one.
