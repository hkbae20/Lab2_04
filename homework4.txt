1. What is .gitignore? You can write the answer either in Korean or English.
It is a text file that lists all the files that are ignored by Git.
The purpose is to prevent from committing rubbish files that will not be helpful, and thus making the Git cleaner.

2. Why do Github users need an SSH key pair? (Users can use either SSH key pair or github account info.) Please write down a brief explanation of SSH key.
The purpose of the SSH key pair is to allow users to push to Github without having to type in the username and password every time.
A pair consists of a public key and a private key. The private key is stored on one's local computer, and the public key on Github.
When the private key matches the public key, the user can gain access.
Although it seems unsafe, it is used because with SSH encryption, it is impossible for someone to reverse engineer a private key by only looking at the public key.
