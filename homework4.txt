1. What is .gitignore? You can write the answer either in Korean or English.
If there are files or directories that you do not want them to be in the project, you can exclude those files with the .gitignore.
2. Why do Github users need an SSH key pair? (Users can use either SSH key pair or github account info.) Please write down a brief explanation of SSH key.
SSH key pair is more secure than github account info, and also users are identified by SSH key. So only authorized users who know the SSH key pair can access to the specific directory.
